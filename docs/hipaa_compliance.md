# HIPAA Compliance Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines how the application adheres to HIPAA regulations to ensure the privacy and security of Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Compliance Measures

### 1. Data Privacy

- **Local Processing**: All data processing occurs on the local machine. No PHI is transmitted over a network.
- **In-Memory Operations**: Sensitive data is processed in RAM and never written to disk.

### 2. Data Security

- **Secure Memory Management**: Uses `SecureAllocator` to ensure sensitive data is securely overwritten after use.
- **User Authentication**: Implements 2FA and RBAC to restrict access to authorized users.

### 3. PHI Handling

- **PHI Scrubbing**: Uses NER and regex patterns to detect and redact PHI before display.

### 4. Audit Controls

- **Logging**: Custom logging module ensures no PHI is logged. Logs essential application events for auditing purposes.

## Risk Analysis

- **Data Breach Risk**: Minimized by local processing and secure memory management.
- **Unauthorized Access**: Mitigated through strong user authentication mechanisms.

## Administrative Safeguards

- **User Training**: Users should be trained on proper use and security practices.
- **Policies and Procedures**: Organizations should establish policies for device use and security.
